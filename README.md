# Make 10

Several weeks ago, I was in a train carriage that had the carriage number 1404. As I'm not one to follow the rules exactly, I came up with the solution `1 × 40 ÷ 4` - I often do this by covering the other two numbers with my hands and shooting a cheeky smile back at whoever has the misfortune of accompanying me that day. But I knew it was cheating, so I kept thinking about it, and came to the conclusion that there is no way allowed by the rules to solve that particular set of numbers, a conclusion supported by [Kang-Wei Chan's calculator](https://www.kangweichan.com/make-10). So I started wondering about other combinations of numbers that also have no solution without cheating, and how that changes as you introduce different rules.

## The Rules

These are the rules of Make 10 as I think everyone would agree on them:

1. Using the digits of the train carriage number and the operators +-×÷, make 10.
2. You must use all the digits once each.
3. You may use parentheses.

These are the house rules I learned from my friends in high school, which will differ by friend group:

4. The digits do not need to be in order.
5. You may use digits as powers (e.g. `2311` → `2^3 + 1 + 1 = 10`).
6. You may use factorials (e.g. `4651` → `4! ÷ 6 + 5 + 1 = 10`).

And my personal house rule, which people tend not to like:

7. You may combine digits into one number, so long as they are already together and in order (e.g. `1404` → `1 × 40 ÷ 4 = 10`).

## Other Rules

What could be possible if we start introducing other rules as well?

8. Why do the digits of a two-digit number need to be together and in order?
9. What about three digits? Are they even useful?
10. What if we allow digits to be decimals?
11. If we're already using exponentials, why not logarithms?
12. What about other functions? The gamma function, rounding/floor/ceiling, trig and inverse trig?

## My Questions

- Is there some combination of the rules that makes every four-digit number solvable?
  - If so, what is the smallest set of rules with this property?
- Are there some combinations of four digits that cannot be solved?
  - If so, what properties do they have that make them unsolvable?
- What happens if you generalise the goal to "Make N"?
- What happens if you generalise the problem to "Make N out of K digits"?
